## How to Run

In order to run the code for the learning environment, you must first install the requirements for the code. To do so, create a virtual environment using `python -m venv virtual-environment-name` and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

After installing the requirements, you are able to start the learning script. Most of the code is contained in the `vec_rr.py` file, and in it you can configure the NN architecture and training hyperparameters.

To run the code, simply input `python vec_rr.py` into the terminal.
